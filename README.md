## VS Code Configuration

### Recommended Extension

This project recommends installing the [oxc extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oxc.oxc-vscode) for the best development experience.

### Editor Settings

The included `.vscode/settings.json` provides the following configurations:

- **Format on Save**: oxfmt automatically formats your code when you save a file
- **Read-only Files**: The following files are set to read-only to prevent accidental edits:
  - `**/*.md` — Markdown files should be managed by AI, not edited directly
  - `bun.lock` — Auto-generated lockfile, should not be manually modified
  - `**/routeTree.gen.ts` — Auto-generated by TanStack Router, should not be manually modified

## About oxlint Configuration

This starter intentionally uses **strict oxlint rules** with all categories set to `error`. This is designed to encourage best practices and catch potential issues early. Feel free to adjust these rules according to your project's needs by modifying `.oxlintrc.json`.

Additionally, oxlint is configured to perform **type checking** alongside linting, providing comprehensive code analysis in a single tool.
